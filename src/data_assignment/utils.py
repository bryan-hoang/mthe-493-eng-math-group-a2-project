    '''
    New idea: calculate the max_employable
    then, find the max_employable workers that have sum s_max >= n.
    This may be O(n!), unless we can optimize further
    (it will be a subset-sum algorithm)
    algorithm:
    1. select the cheapest max_employable workers
    2: if max_employable > k, return selected
    3. set swap_idx = len(selected) - 1 (the most expensive worker)
    4. if sum (selected s_max < n), swap the most expensive selected with the least expensive worker having larger s_max


    other thought:
    - calculate sum s_max for all subsets of max_employable workers
    '''
    # max_employable = n // s_min
    # # it's important that these lists remain sorted by c
    # selected = eligible[:max_employable]
    # unselected = eligible[max_employable:]
    # # check if we've already got the best selection
    # if max_employable > len(selected) or get_capacity(selected) >= n:
    #     return selected
    # # otherwise, we need to do some swapping, starting with the most expensive selected workers
    # # this doesn't guarantee an optimal solution; we will (on each pass) swap the most expensive

    # # WE SHOULD EXAMINE: how much capacity do we gain vs. how much does it cost?
    # # compare each selected worker to each unselected worker. calculate, for each pair, the capacity gained, and the added expense.
    # # then, check if there is any single swap that will meet required capacity
    # #  -> if one such swap exists, filter all swaps by those that will meet requirement. Then find cheapest one and perform it
    # #  -> otherwise, we need to determine which swaps to consider, and follow multiple paths. Could:
    # #     -> simulate one swap for each selected? (breadth first)
    # #     -> simulate taking swap which increases capacity by the most, or swap which increases cost by the least?
    # for swap_idx in range(len(selected) - 1, -1, -1):
    #     did_swap = False
    #     # pop swappable worker
    #     to_unselect = selected.pop(swap_idx)
    #     # capacity of remaining selected workers
    #     partial_capacity = get_capacity(selected)
    #     required_s_max = n - partial_capacity
    #     # find an unselected worker with required s_max

    #         if w.s_max >= required_s_max:
    #             insert_to_sorted_list(selected, w, key=lambda x: x.c)
